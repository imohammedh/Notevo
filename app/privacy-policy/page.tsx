              Our Privacy Policy does not apply to other websites. Thus, we
              advise you to consult the respective Privacy Policies of these

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Cookies</h2>
            <p>
              Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your device by your
              browser. They serve various purposes, such as remembering your
              preferences, enhancing user experience, and facilitating
              authentication.
            </p>
            <p>
              At our Site, we utilize third-party authentication services,
              including Google OAuth, to secure and streamline the login
              process. When you log in using Google OAuth, a cookie is generated
              and stored on your device. This cookie is essential for the proper
              functioning of our authentication system.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Google OAuth cookie contains a unique identifier that helps us
              recognize your authenticated session. It enables you to access our
              application seamlessly without needing to re-enter your
              credentials repeatedly during a single session.
            </p>
            <p>
              These cookies do not store personal information directly on our
              servers. Instead, they serve as tokens that establish a secure
              connection between your browser and the authentication provider,
              in this case, Google. This enhances the security of the
              authentication process while providing a more user-friendly
              experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              By using our Site and opting for third-party authentication, you
              consent to the use of cookies for authentication purposes. You can
              manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings.
