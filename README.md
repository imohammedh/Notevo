This is a [Convex](https://convex.dev/) project created with [`npm create convex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-convex).

After the initial setup (<2 minutes) you'll have a working full-stack app using:

- Convex as your backend (database, server logic)
- [Convex Auth](https://labs.convex.dev/auth) for your authentication implementation
- [React](https://react.dev/) as your frontend (web page interactivity)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for optimized web hosting and page routing
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for building great looking accessible UI fast

## Get started

If you just cloned this codebase and didn't use `npm create convex`, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you're reading this README on GitHub and want to use this template, run:

```
npm create convex@latest -- -t nextjs-convexauth-shadcn
```

## The app

The app is a basic multi-user chat. Walkthrough of the source code:

- [convex/auth.ts](./convex/auth.ts) configures the available authentication methods
- [convex/messages.ts](./convex/messages.ts) is the chat backend implementation
- [middleware.ts](./middleware.ts) determines which pages require sign-in
- [app/layout.tsx](./app/layout.tsx) is the main app layout
- [app/(splash)/page.tsx](<./app/(splash)/page.tsx>) is the splash page (doesn't require sign-in)
- [app/product/layout.tsx](./app/product/layout.tsx) is the "product" layout for the [product page](./app/product/page.tsx) (requires sign-in)
- [app/signin/page.tsx](./app/signin/page.tsx) is the sign-in page
- [app/product/Chat/Chat.tsx](./app/product/Chat/Chat.tsx) is the chat frontend

## Configuring other authentication methods

To configure different authentication methods, see [Configuration](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/config) in the Convex Auth docs.
